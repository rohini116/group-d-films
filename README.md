Group D Film Project


For this app project the team used themoviedb API: https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api.

The project used a single repo which contained the server and client code.

The team agreed that for the MVP we should have the following goals:

1: The backend (server) will be responsible for servicing all the endpoints the client (frontend) will use (see: https://github.com/skip-rat/group-d-films/tree/main/server) for more information

2: The app will display the 'current days' trending movies in cards

3: The app will allow the user to select a movie genre and then display movies from the selected genre

4: The app will have a health page as per the project requirements

5: The app will have an about page with a list of team members names

6: The app will display a 404 page when an invalid url is returned

7: The app will briefly displaying loading message before displaying the 'trending' movies 

8: Styling of the app will use CSS (no SCSS) and BEM notation 


You can run the project using the following steps


1: Clone the repo

2: Run npm install in the root, client and server folder

3: To start the app run the 'npm start' command from the root folder (this will start the 'server' and 'client')
